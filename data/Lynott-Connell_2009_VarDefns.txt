Item# = Number of property word in alphabetical order (1-423)

Property = Word that describes target property

Familiarity = Proportion of participants that were familiar with the meaning of the property word (0-100%)

VisualStrengthMean = Mean rating (0-5) of how strongly property is experienced by seeing

HapticStrengthMean = Mean rating (0-5) of how strongly property is experienced by feeling through touch

AuditoryStrengthMean = Mean rating (0-5) of how strongly property is experienced by hearing

OlfactoryStrengthMean = Mean rating (0-5) of how strongly property is experienced by smelling

GustatoryStrengthMean = Mean rating (0-5) of how strongly property is experienced by tasting

VisualStrengthSD = Standard deviation of visual strength ratings

HapticStrengthSD = Standard deviation of haptic strength ratings

AuditoryStrengthSD = Standard deviation of auditory strength ratings

OlfactoryStrengthSD = Standard deviation of olfactory strength ratings

GustatoryStrengthSD = Standard deviation of gustatory strength ratings

DominantModality = Modality through which property is experienced most strongly (i.e., with highest strength rating)

ModalityExclusivity = Extent to which property is experienced though a single perceptual modality (0 â€“ 100%), calculated as range of 
strength values divided by their sum

BNCFrequency = Frequency per million words in the British National Corpus (2001)

BNCLogFrequency = Natural logarithm of BNC frequency (one unit was added to the BNC frequency prior to transform to allow for words of zero frequency)

OrthographicLength = Number of letters in property word
